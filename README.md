### Is an RDF data browser Javascript-based application.  
Lucinda is a general RDF-resource browser which could be configured to work with any triplestore providing a SPARQL-endpoint address. LUCINDA can also integrate in it [OSCAR](https://github.com/opencitations/oscar), The OpenCitations RDF Search Application.  
In this repository you can find few examples of Lucinda usage. Currently we have tested Lucinda with two different projects: [OpenCitations](http://opencitations.net/), and [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org/). For each one of these projects we have its corresponding .html main entry, try the Wikidata example, presented at [Wikicite2018](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite_2018), at [example/wikidata/browser.html](https://opencitations.github.io/lucinda/example/wikidata/browser.html?browse=Q30536251) .
